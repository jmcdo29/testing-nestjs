# Knexjs Sample

Welcome to the example of using Knexjs with Nest and running tests! I decided to use a very simple CRUD application for a single database object.
There isn't much more to say except I hope this is found useful for the community!

## Side note

For this application, I have added for use a knexjs package called `nest-knexjs`(see [here](https://github.com/Tony133/nestjs-knexjs)) for use of knexjs with Nestjs. Meanwhile, enjoy the rehearsals!
